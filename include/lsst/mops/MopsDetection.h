 * This is the "lightened" Detection class; it contains only the data needed by
 * DayMops to do its work.  It does not attempt to hold as much data as real
 * DiaSource, or even as would be held in Miti format.  But since we expect data
 * transmission to be an issue in LSST, we're cutting down on the size of data
 * here.
