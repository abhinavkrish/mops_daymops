/*  
    Linkage is the base class for Track and Tracklet; it should export
    the same interface, allowing the same Tree class to hold Tracks or
    Tracklets.

    You should be able to differentiate between them easily by
    checking the dimensionality of their best-fit functions; tracklets
    have linear underlying models and tracks have quadratic or higher.
