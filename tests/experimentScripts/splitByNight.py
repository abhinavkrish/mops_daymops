Split up the "simplified" DIAsources by night and put them in separate
files.  These are assumed to have a temporary format of

ID obshistid SSM_ID RA DECL MJD MAG sn

as created by running < dias_nodeep_pt1 awk '{print $2, $6, $10, $13,
$36, $39, $59}' > dias.short and then using addUniqueIds.py to add an
initial ID column.

lower-case items are ignored.
