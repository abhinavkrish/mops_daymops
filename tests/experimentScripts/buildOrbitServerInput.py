Build input for orbit_server.x.  Takes as input a set of detections in
MITI format and a set of tracks expressed as DiaSourceIds.  outputs a
variety of files with a given prefix, as orbit_server.x enjoys.

Unlike the PS version, we do not require that a track be made of
tracklets but merely of a set of detections.  (Kubica's linkTracklets
will allow this to happen, as will ours, though it is unlikely except
in fairly dense observations.)  To allow this, we actually write
"singleton tracklets" (i.e., single detections) to the ".in.tracklets"
file handed to orbit_server.  This actually appears to work just fine!

output files

prefix.in.manifest : lists the names of the three files we are writing. Not sure why we need this!
prefix.in.tracklets : holds the tracklets (really, the detections) comprising the tracks.
prefix.in.request : holds the tracks, and the flag requesting IOD be performed on them
