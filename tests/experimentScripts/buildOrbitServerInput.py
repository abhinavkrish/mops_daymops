Build input(s) for orbit_server.x.  This script takes as input a set
of tracks expressed as DiaSourceIds; the DiaSources are looked up from
a database.  It then outputs a variety of files with a given prefix,
as orbit_server.x enjoys.  The outputs are sets of files to be used
for orbit_server.x.  Because orbit_server.x has a hard-coded maximum
number of items in its input files, it is usually necessary to write
many sets of files.


output files

prefix_num.in.manifest : lists the names of the three files we are writing. Not sure why we need this!
prefix_num.in.tracklets : holds the tracklets (really, the detections) comprising the tracks.
prefix_num.in.request : holds the tracks, and the flag requesting IOD be performed on them

orbit_server.x takes a maximum of 500000 items in the .in.tracklets file.

It also appears to take a maximum of about 24000 items in the .in.request file.

We will create as many sets of files as needed.

Unlike the PS version, we do not require that a track be made of
tracklets but merely of a set of detections.  (Kubica's linkTracklets
will allow this to happen, as will ours, though it is unlikely except
in fairly dense observations.)  To allow this, we actually write
"singleton tracklets" (i.e., single detections) to the ".in.tracklets"
file handed to orbit_server.  This actually appears to work just fine
- I tested by taking one of the PS examples and renaming the tracklets
and changing the contents of the tracks and got the same results out.
