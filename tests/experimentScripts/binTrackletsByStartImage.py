FUNCTIONALITY:

This script uses the DB to look up the obsHistId of the first
detection in each tracklet, and dump the tracklet to a file with that
obsHistId.


RATIONALE:

In order to get a better load distribution (sorta...) of our
linkTracklets runs, we'd like to distribute workloads by image rather
than night.  To do this we need to separate out the tracklets by first
image time.  Since there are a LOT of tracklets, we're going to put
them into carefully-named files rather than put them into the DB.
