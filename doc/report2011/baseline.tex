\title{Moving Object Pipeline System Design}

\author{Jonathan Myers, Lynne Jones, Tim Axelrod}

\begin{abstract}

The Moving Object Pipeline System (MOPS) has two responsibilities
within LSST Data Management.  First, it is responsible for generating
and managing the \textbf{Moving Object} data products.  The Moving
Objects are identified solar system objects (SSOs) with associated
Keplerian orbits, errors, and detected sources associated with those
solar system objects.  The second responsibility of the MOPS is to
predict future locations of moving objects in incoming images so that
their sources may be associated with known objects; this will reduce
the number of transient detections and prevent Alert Generation on
detections of known Solar System objects.  Design for the MOPS
component is based closely on the design of the PanSTARRS MOPS.
