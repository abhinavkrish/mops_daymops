\section{System Design and Responsibilities}

The Moving Object Pipeline System has two main responsibilities: the
generation and maintenance of the Moving Object database, and the
prediction of known object locations which are sent to the Association
Pipeline to prevent unneccessary alerts.  The MOPS has been broken
into two components, colloquially known as ``DayMOPS'' and ``NightMOPS.''

``DayMOPS,'' so called because it processes data acquired from the
previous night in a large batch operation, is responsible for
discovering new Moving Objects in newly-acquired data, searching old
data for detections of new objects, and updating the Moving Objects
table to reflect newly-acquired data. It is also responsible for
periodically cleaning and refining the contents of the Moving Objects
table.  ``NightMOPS'' is responsible for projecting the locations of known
Moving Objects in upcoming images as they are announced during
night-time operations.  

The relationship between DayMOPS, NightMOPS and the neighboring
components of the LSST Data Management system is illustrated in
figure \ref{mopsWithinLsst}.

\subsection{DayMOPS: Discovering and Managing Moving Objects}

The DayMOPS is responsible for discovering moving objects in source
catalogs.  The task of discovering and tracking asteroids has been
performed by humans since hundreds of years ago, but automated systems
for asteroid discovery and tracking remain relatively uncommon.  Other
surveys have often mixed human and computerized approaches -
\textbf{can we get some more history here?}.


The design of the LSST DayMOPS is based on the PanSTARRS Moving Object
Pipeline System \citep{psMOPSDesign}.  The approach used here is to
first find sets of detections with sky-plane paths consistent with
asteroid behaviour; these sets of detections and their fitted paths
are called \textbf{tracks}.  A set of algorithms for the discovery of
sky-plane tracks in dense data are presented in
\citet{Kubica:2005:MTA:1081870.1081889}; these algorithms are the
basis of the linking methods for the current LSST DayMOPS.


%% TBD: it would be really nice to have some illustrations here
%% showing detections of an object, and possibly tracklets and tracks
%% as well

The tracking methods used are based on a tiered approach; first two or
more detections from a single night are linked into
\textbf{tracklets}, which represent a hypothetical object and a linear
approximation of its sky-plane motion.  These tracklets are later
joined into larger tracks. Because of the increasing complexity of
sky-plane motion over time, we are generally interested in tracks
which span no more than 15-30 days of observation time.

The PanSTARRS MOPS uses a fairly loose and generous approximation of
asteroid motion.  This allows for many mislinkages or \textbf{false
  tracks}, combining detections which are not attributable to the same
source, but virtually all objects for which a true (correctly-linked)
track could be generated will get some correct track.  With LSST's
expected density of detections, we found that this glut of false
tracks was generally too painful.  As a result, our methods diverge
from those of PanSTARRS as we introduce some more strict filters on
tracks, reducing the number of mislinkages at the expense of
potentially missing some true tracks.  The algorithms, their
implementations, the additional filters, and their behaviors are
presented thoroughly in Chapter \ref{linking}.

Once tracks are discovered, they are sent to the Orbit Determination
phase. The Orbit Determination phase takes these sets of sky-plane
detections and attempts to find a Keplerian orbit which could generate
the detections.  This orbit is further refined, and error bounds are
established, using differential correction.  Orbit Determination will
reject many tracks as false, but should successfully find precise
orbits for virtually all correctly linked tracks.  Several methods for
performing this task are known, and several have open-source implementations
available to LSST \citep{Milani04orbitdetermination},
\citep{Milani2006}, \citep{OpenOrb2009}, \citep{granvik_thesis}.  The
orbits discovered by Orbit Determination, and the detections present
in the track associated with each orbit, are used to generate new
Moving Objects.

  modifications of the Moving Objects table in a variety of ways,

  the discovery of new objects, and periodic refinements of the Moving
  Object table, such as possible merges of redundant objects or
  removal of false orbits. }

The DayMOPS is expected to perform several additional tasks to manage
and improve the Moving Objects table over time.  Attribution is the
process of identifying known objects in incoming data and adding those
detections to the correct Moving Object, in a process called
Attribution. Similarly, Precovery is the recovery of known,
unattributed detections associated with a newly-discovered Moving
Object.  Another refinement is the merging of potentially redundant
Moving Objects.  The complete set of DayMOPS tasks and their data
flows are illustrated in figure \ref{mopsDiagram}.
